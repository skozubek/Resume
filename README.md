#Responsive Resume Site (UDACITY FEND project).

- The desktop version of the site has a 3-column layout. The resume has a “sidebar” for the headings.
- The tablet version has a 2-column layout. The resume headings are placed above each section in the resume.
- The mobile version completely hides photo, focusing on just the information in the resume.

#Notes
- Resize the browser window to see the site's layout changing.
- Once the viewport exceeds a width of 1280px, the resume is not expanded, just the right margin is added for better readability.
