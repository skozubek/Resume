#Responsive Resume Site (UDACITY FEND project).

-The desktop version of the site has a 3-column layout. The resume has a “sidebar” for the headings.
-The tablet version has a 2-column layout. The resume headings are placed above each section in the resume.
-The mobile version completely hides photo, focusing on just the information in the resume.

#Notes
-Resize the browser window to see the site's layout changing
-once the viewport exceedsa width of 1280px, resume is not expanded, just the righ margin is added for better readability
